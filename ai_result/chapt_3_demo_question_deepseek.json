    "question": "When implementing a generic singly linked list using templates, what is the main advantage?",
    "answers": ["It automatically sorts the elements upon insertion.", "It can store elements of arbitrary, specified types without rewriting the node class.", "It guarantees constant-time access to any element by index.", "It eliminates the need for a head pointer."],
